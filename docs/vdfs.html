    <h1>B-Em VDFS</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>VDFS is an emulator-specific filing system for the BBC Micro
      that allows access to a subset of the filesystem of the host,
      i.e. the PC running the emulator. The concept is very similar
      to the way in which modern virtual machine software such as
      VirtualBox allows the guest to view parts of the host filesystem
      as if it were a network drive, though the implementation is
      rather different.</p>
    <p>In use it is very similar to ADFS, because this is the most
      natural way to map the host filesystem which will be
      hierarchical, but with a little of NFS. It is not aimed at
      proving a completely authentic experience and there are no
      noises, no speed restrictions and no emulation of DFS-specfic
      rather than generalised filing system behaviour. Where it is most
      useful is in being able to share files fast between the host and
      the guest, for example when developing software on the guest
      where the editor or some other part of the toolchain runs on the
      host and then the software needs to run on the guest BBC for
      testing, possibly with one or more toolchain steps on the guest
      before that.</p>
    <h2>Implementations</h2>
    <p>The VDFS concept started life on a BBC emulator running under
      RiscOS.  There are two implementations I am aware of for PC-based
      emulators: the one I wrote for B-Em, which the rest of this
      documentation is about, and another one for BeebEm by J.G.
      Harston.</p>
    <h2>Enabling and Selecting VDFS</h2>
    <p>Two things are required to be able to use VDFS in B-Em:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The VDFS ROM must be present.</li>
      <li>It must be enabled in the settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>VDFS ROM</h3>
    <p>The VDFS ROM is supplied as part of B-Em in
      <code>roms/general/vdfs.rom</code>.  This ROM is included in the
      default machine configurations but if you have configured a
      custom machine, or have removed it, then you would need to add
      it.  For basic use, there is no requirement for it to occupy any
      particular slot, though on machines other than the master the
      slot will determine whether it can become the default filing
      system at startup or will need to be selected explicitly.</p>
    <h3>Settings</h3>
    <p>The setting for VDFS is under the "Disc" menu.  When this is
      ticked, VDFS is enabled:</p>
    <img src="setting.png">
    <h3>Choosing the Root Directory</h3>
    <p>For secutity reasons, VDFS does not allow the whole filsystem
      on the host to be seen from the guest.  Instead one chooses a
      specific directory on the host that will then become the virtual
      root directory on the guest.  This means the guest (BBC Micro)
      can see anything in that directory of any sub-directory thereof
      but not anything above that level.</p>
    <p>This VDFS root directory is specified either by setting the
      environment variable BEM_VDFS_ROOT before starting b-em or
      by choosing "Choose VDFS Root" from the Disc menu which will
      then present a file chooser dialogue configured to select a
      directory rather than a file.</p>
    <h3>Selection on Startup</h3>
    <p>When enabled, as above, VDFS is a candidate for selection
      on startup as the default filing system.  Whether this happens
      depends on the order of the ROMs in the slots and on whether
      keys are held down during startup.  VDFS will be selected
      when it is either the highest priority filing system selected
      and no keys are held down, or when the 'S' key is held down.</p>
    <p>On the master, the default filing system can be configured
      as one of the CMOS settings.  The syntax is:</p>
    <p><kbd>*CONFIGURE FILE &lt;n&gt;</kbd></p>
    <p>where &lt;n&gt; n is the number of the ROM containing the
      filing system.</p>
    <h3>Selection via Command or ROM Service Call</h3>
    <p>If enabled in the settings, VDFS can always be selected
      with the command:</p>
    <p><kbd>*VDFS</kbd></p>
    <p>or by issusing a ROM service call with A=&amp;12 and Y=&amp;11,
      with &amp;11 being the filing system number normally used by
      VDFS.</p>
    <p>Depending on which priority slot the VDFS ROM is in and the
      FSCLAIM setting, VDFS may also be selected by commands and
      service calls that would otherwise select the DFS or ADFS filing
      systems.  This is to enable VDFS to be used with programs which
      embed either commands or service calls to start these other
      filing systems without having to patch the programs
      concerned.</p>
    <p>In order to step in in place of another filing system in this
      way, the VDFS ROM needs to be in a higher priority ROM slot than
      the filing system concerned so that the VDFS ROM sees the
      command or service call first.</p>
    <p>Assuming this is the case, after executing:</p>
    <p><kbd>*FSCLAIM ON</kbd></p>
    <p>VDFS will be selected when any of:</p>
    <p><kbd>*DFS</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*ADFS</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*FADFS</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*VDFS</kbd></p>
    <p>are executed or when the ROM service call with A=&amp;12 is
      issued with Y=&amp;04, Y=&amp;08 or Y=&amp;11.  After
      executing:</p>
    <p><kbd>*FSCLAIM OFF</kbd></p>
    <p>VDFS will only be selected with:</p>
    <p><kbd>*VDFS</kbd></p>
    <p>or by issusing a ROM service call with A=&amp;12 and Y=&amp;11.
    <h2>Using VDFS</h2>
    <h3>VDFS from Programs</h3>
    <p>VDFS implements the complete set of filing system calls
      including OSGBPB so should work from existing programs like
      any other filing system, provided the program does not make
      assumptions about the directory structure.</p>
    <p>It is worth noting that, as well as embedding filing system
      selection commands as noted above, some programs may change
      their behaviour according to the number of the filing system
      selected.  The BCPL ROM is a case in point which, if it does not
      recognise the filing system, assumes it only implements the
      core filing system calls as implemented by the cassette and
      ROM filing systems.  Unfortunately the latest filing system this
      ROM knows about is DFS and this can make it very slow on more
      modern filing systems.  This could be addressed via *FSCLAIM
      above as that causes VDFS to report as having the filing system
      number of the filing system it is standing in for.  In that case
      you would have VDFS stand in for DFS by doing:
    <p><kbd>*FSCLAIM ON</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*DISC</kbd></p>
    <p>Another solution is to patch the BCPL ROM and a patched version
      is available in the <a href="https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15834&start=30#p217677">fstest.zip
      file attached to this forum post</a>.</p>
    <h3>VDFS Commands</h3>
    <p>The following commands are implemented by VDFS:</p>
    <p><kbd>*BACK</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*CAT</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*CDIR</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*DELETE</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*DIR</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*EX/kbd><br>
    <kbd>*INFO/kbd><br>
    <kbd>*RENAME</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*RESCAN</kbd></p>
    <p>All of these have the same meaning as under ADFS except for
      RESCAN which is VDFS-specific and can be used to force VDFS
      to re-scan host directories if it has not picked up changes
      made directly on the host.</p>
    <p>The following commands are recognised but do nothing:</p>
    <p><kbd>*ACCESS</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*BACKUP</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*COMPACT</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*COPY</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*DESTROY</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*DRIVE</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*ENABLE</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*FORM</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*FREE</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*MAP</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*MOUNT</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*TITLE</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*VERIFY</kbd><br>
    <kbd>*WIPE</kbd></p>
    <h3>Attribute Mapping</h3>
    <p>VDFS supplies attributes to programs and displays them in the
      catalogue in the form used for NFS.  In the catalogue display
      this means those that apply to the current user are in capitals
      and those that apply to others are in lower case.  For example
      here is a directory set up to look like the system disc for
      a Music 5000 system:</p>
    <img src="m5000sysg.png">
    <p>and here is the same directory display on a Linux host:</p>
    <img src="m5000sysh.png">
    <p>The NFS "current user" attributes are taken from the host
      file permissions that apply to the user running the emulator.
      The NFS "public" permissions are a composite - if anyone else
      on the host system is able to perform the action concerned
      however they get that permission, the NFS permission is
      considered to be granted, so in the case of Linux this includes
      permissions obtained via the group mechanism.</p>
    <p>As noted above the *ACCESS command does not do anything on
      VDFS and neither does the OSFILE call to set file attributes.  It
      is simply not clear how this operation should be translated to
      work on the host system and would differ between Windows and
      Linux.  If you need to change file permissions you will need
      to do it on the host.</p>
    <p>The Acorn-specific LOAD and EXEC addresses are supported - these
      are held in <em>.inf</em> files on the host, one for each real
      file, visible in the image above.  These are intended to be
      compatible with SWH's <em>beeb</em> and Acorn-aware ZIP
      archivers.</p>
    <h3>Filename Mapping</h3>
    <p>Acorn filenames are limited to 10 characters so host filenames
      longer than this are truncated before being presented to code
      running on the emulated BBC micro.  Also, the set of characters
      that can be included in Acorn filenames and the set of characters
      that have special meanings will be different from those on the
      host.  Looking at these two rows of characters:</p>
    <p><code># $ % &amp; . ? @ ^<br>
      ? < ; + / # = ></code></p>
    <p>whenever one of the characters in the top row is found in a
      host filename it is translated to the corresponding one on the
      bottom row.  If the combination of truncation and/or mapping
      would result in more than one host file appearing to have the
      same name to the guest this is resolved by adding a ~ character
      and a numeric suffix, truncating the name further, if necessary,
      to make room for the suffix.  This is modelled after the way
      Windows deals with multiple long filenames mapping to the same
      8.3 filename.</p>
    <p>In the reverse direction, VDFS will remember the guest name it
      gave to each host file, though only while B-Em continues to run,
      so adding or removing files should not cause the mapping to
      become unstable.  When VDFS sees a new guest name, for example
      when creating a new file, it performs the mapping in reverse,
      i.e. any character on the bottom row is translated to the
      corresponding character on the top row before the file is
      created on the host.</p>
    <h2>Internals</h2>
    <p>VDFS is implemented through co-operation between a service
      ROM that runs from within the guest BBC micro and a module
      within the emulator, vdfs.c.</p>
    <p>The ROM receives requests from the BBC Micro MOS or user
      programs via the normal paged ROM service calls and by setting
      the filing system vectors to point to routines within this ROM
      when it is selected as the current filing system.  As necessary,
      control is then passed to the emulator module.</p>
    <p>In the original RiscOS emulator, the mechanism by which control
      was transferred was an undocumented 6502 instruction, i.e. the
      ROM would use this instruction and the processor emulator would
      trap to the emulator module when it went to execute this
      instruction.  In B-Em some effort has been put into make the
      emulated 6502 behave as close to a real one as possible and that
      includes executing undocumented insructions as a real CPU
      would.  B-Em therefore takes a slighly different approach and
      uses a set of four ports in the JIM (1Mhz bus) area starting
      at &amp;FC5C.</p>
    <h3>&amp;FC5C - Flags</h3>
    <p>In version 5 of VDFS, the current master version, this
      is simply a boolean flag which corresponds to the FSCLAIM
      setting, i.e. whether VDFS should initialise itself when a
      command or service call attempts to select ADFS or DFS.</p>
    <p>In version 6 of VDFS this will enable individual selection
      or whether VDFS claims ADFS and/or DFS with bit 7 (&amp;80)
      meaning claim ADFS and bit 6 (&amp;40) meaning claim DFS</p>
    <h3>&amp;FC5D - Filing System Number</h3>
    <p>When VDFS is the current filing system, this is set to the
      filing system number that caused it to initialise, i.e. if
      this is not &amp;11, VDFS usual filing system number, this is the
      number of the filing system VDFS is pretending to be.  When
      VDFS is not the current filing system this is zero.</p>
    <h3>&amp;FC5E - Command</h3>
    <p>Stroring a value in this port causes the vdfs.c module to
      take some action.  The values as used for VDFS version 5
      are:</p>

    <p>There are fewer command codes for VDFS 6 because the new code
      for ROM sevice call means more functions are implemented in the
      vdfs.c module and less in the ROM.  In particular OS command
      parsing is now in vdfs.c so there is no need for a separate
      command code for each command.</p>
    <p>VDFS version 6 also adds a mechanism to transfer control in
      the other direction.  Normally, when the command port is written
      to the corresponding action is carried out and the emulated 6502
      continues from the next instruction.  With VDFS 6 the vdfs.c
      module may instead set the PC for the emulated CPU to some other
      address within the ROM to continue execution there and to do so
      uses a table of addresses wthin the ROM.  The first three bytes
      of the VDFS ROM, where the language entry would be if it were
      a language ROM, describe this table with the first byte at
      &amp;8000 being the number of enties and thd next two at
      &amp;8001 and &amp;8002 pointing to the first entry.  At the time
      of writing the correspondance between internal vdfs.c action
      codes, table entries and the associated assenmbler routine in

    <h3>&amp;FC5F - Save A</h3>
    <p>Unlike the scheme that used an undocumented instruction, writing
      to a port means one of the emulated processor's register has to
      be loaded with the value to write but some commands may need to
      pass values in all three 6502 registers to the routine in
      vdfs.c</p>
    <p>This solves the problem by allowing the accumulator (A) to
      be written here, then loaded with the command code.  As soon
      as the command code is written to &amp;FC5E above the vdfs.c
      module puts the value that was written to this port back into A
      before dispatching to the routine that implements the command
      code concerned.  This means a typical invocation of an action in
      vdfs.c looks like this in 6502 assembler:</p
    <code><pre>sta     port_a   ; &amp;FC5F
lda     #&amp;01
sta     port_cmd ; &amp;FC5E
rts</pre></code>
