B-em v1.1
=========

Source for the DOS, Windows and OS X versions are included. The DOS
version should/may also compile under Linux/QNX/BeOS, although I haven't
tried this. The Windows and OS X versions use a lot of platform-specific code,
and will not compile on other platforms.

The OS X source is of version v1.0, the others are of v1.1.

The DOS and Windows versions will not compile under GCC 4 as I have this bad
habit of declaring variables in multiple source files instead of using header
files properly. The OS X version has been corrected and does compile. For v1.0
I tried to correct this, at least in the DOS port.

For the DOS version, you will need :
DJGPP
Allegro
Zlib
2xSaI (modified Allegro version)

For the Windows version, you will need :
Ming/W
Allegro
Zlib
2xSaI (modified Allegro version)

For the OS X version you need :
Xcode
Allegro
Zlib

Just compile and link all the C files with the above libraries.
